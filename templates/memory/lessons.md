<!--
EXAMPLES TO INSPIRE YOU:

## React
- Always wrap data-fetching components in Suspense boundaries
- Don't use useEffect for data fetching — use TanStack Query instead
- memo() only helps if the parent actually re-renders frequently
- useCallback/useMemo only when passed to memoized children or expensive (>1ms)

## TypeScript
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes — better error messages
- Use `import type` to avoid circular dependency issues at runtime

## Git
- Always use HEREDOC format for multi-line commit messages
- Never amend commits after pushing — creates history problems

## Testing
- Test behavior, not implementation — test what users see
- Avoid testing internal state directly

## API Design
- Return consistent error shapes from all endpoints
- Always validate input at the API boundary, not just in the service layer

## Performance
- Measure before optimizing — don't assume where the bottleneck is
- Code splitting at route level gives biggest wins for initial load time
